;;; swap-braces.el - a minor mode to swap square and curly braces

;;; Installation: 

;; Drop it in your load path and (require 'swap-braces).
;; Possibly also (add-hook 'foo-mode-hook 'swap-braces-mode).

;;; Commentary:

;; The swap function explicitly instructs Linum to schedule an update,
;; if Linum mode is enabled; otherwise, Linum does not automatically 
;; update while Swap-Braces mode is enabled.
;; This seems like it should not be necessary, and I'm uncertain whether 
;; it has greater implications regarding interaction between this mode 
;; and others. 
;; (That is, it makes me worry that something about how I've implemented 
;; this makes it screw up other modes using post-command-hook. Caveat user!)

  "When active, swap square braces and curly braces, so that e.g. pressing [
elicits '{', and S-[ elicits '['.

The keymap `swap-braces-map' defines this mode's behavior. It is strongly
recommended that you do not define keys in this map which are not self-
inserting characters; the resulting behavior is indeterminate, but almost
certainly not what you intended."
